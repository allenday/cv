*Advisor: Prof. Stanley Nelson, M.D.*
- Built a public data warehouse of DNA microarray data.
  - Wrote webcrawlers to collect and structure data from the deep web.
  - Developed an algorithm for real-time data normalization and data loading,
    improving an $O(n^2)$ algorithm to $O(n)$ complexity.
- Developed a web services protocol to exchange microarray data, enabling
  distributed applcations.
  - Won first prize from the Microarray Gene Expression Data Society for this
    work.

### B.A. in Biology; Biochemistry and Mandarin minors
*2000, University of Oregon, Eugene, USA*
- Worked as a laboratory research assistant and computer programmer for all
  years of attendance. Fields of research included: cognitive psychology,
  genomics, neuroscience.

## Publications and Media

### Data Science in Fintech

  I have recently focused on real-time streaming analytics for data in the
  financial services industry, as this directly relates to the trade and
  logistics industries which comprise a large portion of my home (Singapore)
  economy. I've published a number of original research findings on Google
  Cloud's blog, as well as been interviewed by a number of high-profile media
  organizations about this work.

### Distributed Systems in Biotech

  I've made solutions in medicine/agriculture (erradicating hereditary disease,
  combating infectious disease, ensuring food security), and biosecurity
  (real-time infectious disease deteciton for biosecurity and customs and
  immigration). My focus areas have been to improve human communications and
  collaboration (decentralized, distributed systems and protocols) and
  feasibility/tractability (applying distributed systems techniques to process
  genomic data). My early academic work in this area augured my current fintech
  contributions ([DLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger),
  cryptocurrency analytics) during my tenure at Google, Singapore.

### Data Science in Biotech

  To address pressing problems in medicine (cancer, hereditary and infectious
  diseases)  and agriculture (food security, crop yield), I've applied various
  artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques (recommendation
  systems, deep neural networks) to derive insights from high-throughput bioassay
  data (DNA nanopores, next-gen DNA sequencers, DNA microarrays).

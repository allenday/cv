### Distributed Systems in Biotech

  I worked with a team of scientists developed a system for the decentralized exchange of [computational genomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_genomics) assets. This work augured my future fintech contributions ([DLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger), Cryptocurrency) during my tenure at Google, Singapore.
